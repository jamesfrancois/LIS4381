				Description: Frequently, not only will you be asked to design and develop Web applications, but you will also be asked 
				to create (design) database solutions that interact with the Web application and, in fact, the data 
				repository is the *core* of all Web applications. Hence, the following business requirements. 
 
				A pet store owner, who owns a number of pet stores, requests that you develop a Web application 
				whereby he and his team can record, track, and maintain relevant company data, based upon the 
				following business rules: 
 
				1. A customer can buy many pets, but each pet, if purchased, is purchased by only one customer. 
				2. A store has many pets, but each pet is sold by only one store.
